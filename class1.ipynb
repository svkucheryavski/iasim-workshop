    "1. Pixels and resolution\n",

    "3. Color images as numeric 3D arrays\n",

    "Unlike traditional photos or paintings, digital images are composed of small units called *[pixels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel)*. Each pixel has a specific color or intensity which is coded with one or several numbers. So you can think about *digital image* is a table filled with these numbers. Cells of these tables are pixels. \n",
    "\n",
    "This limitation comes from acquisition devices — cameras. Historically first cameras produced rectangular photos, which was then inherited by modern digital cameras. Here is a schematic representation of how digital camera works:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"illustrations/camera.png\" style=\"width:700px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Any camera consists of optics which focuses light onto a light sensor — a grid of light sensitive elements which produce electric current depending on the intensity of the fallen light. By measuring the current and quantizing the measured values into intensity levels we can save the information about these intensities in form of numbers. And since the sensors are organized to a rectangular grid, the numbers will have the same structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer or other device with a screen turns these numbers to colors. The more pixels you have the smaller they are on the screen and the more fine details you can see. Here is a simple illustration from Wikipedia:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Pixels](illustrations/Pixel-example.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of columns in such table is a *width* of the image and number of rows is its *height*. For example, image of size 800x600 means there are 800 columns and 600 rows (480 000 pixels). \n",
    "\n",
    "The number of pixels is a *resolution* of the image. For instance, a camera of iPhone 14 smartphone produces photos with 2532 x 1170 size — almost 3 millions pixels. A camera of iPhone 14 Plus produces photos with 2778 x 1284 size — almost 3.5 millions. Professional photo cameras, such as Canon EOS 1500D, can make photos of 6000 x 4000 size, which is 24 million pixels. In this case this number often is shortened to 24 Mp (million of pixels).\n",

    "Here is an example of a low resolution digital image zoomed in so the pixels are visible by naked eye:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Bird](illustrations/Bird.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "In some specific cases, for example when we talk about resolution of a screen, we use only number of pixels which fits the width of the screen. For example 4K displays can fit about 4000 pixels along its width (usually 3840 pixels)."

    "The simplest digital image consists of pixels, which are characterized by a single number, its *intensity*. Usually a whole number between 0 and 255 is used in this case. Computer (or any other device, e.g. smartphone or tablet) shows 0 as a black color, 255 as a while color and all numbers in between are shown as shades of gray. Therefore such images are usually called as *grayscale*.\n",

This library is specifically developed to work with *arrays* — this is a way to call tables and other similar structures, which consist of only numbers in mathematics. *Array* is a versatile word for any rectangular structures with numbers, like tables, cuboids, etc. If array represents a table, it is called two-dimensional (2D) array or a *matrix*.\n",

    "Colors in digital images are represented using the RGB (Red, Green, Blue) model. The idea of this model is simple. If you take three light sources (e.g. LED or small lamps), one emits red light, second — green and third — blue. And if you place these three lamps close to each other, then on a distance it will be difficult to distinguish the individual colors, they will mix up to a single one. By changing intensities of the light one can make any color from these three. For example mixing red and green will give you yellow.\n",

The combination of full intensity in all three channels, `(255, 255, 255)`, results in a white color, while absence of intensity in all channels, `(0, 0, 0)`, yields black.\n",
